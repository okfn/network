  This project has two components: 1) The GSODI report on open data concepts,
  open data + AI and policy recommendations and 2) The GSODI index portal. The
  Garden State Open Data Index (GSODI) 2023 report identifies concepts,
  strategies, principles, and policies to enhance the “availability,
  accessibility, usability and governance of open data. This is expected to lead
  to enhanced and accelerated public informatics driven insights, discoveries
  and value creation.” The GSODI is a mechanism that presents an ‘integrated
  view’ and rich metadata on the information ecosystem in New Jersey and is
  globally extensible. The GSODI report provides recommendations for ‘improving
  the effectiveness and efficiency associated with open data initiatives’ by
  integrating metadata information on ‘open-data portals and open-data datasets
  in a cohesive manner’ under a new portal which is expected to be launched in
  2023. The GSODI is designed to support research, decision making, planning,
  and reporting efforts and is expected to lead to more efficient
  insights-generation for an array of constituents across academic, media,
  governance, professional, social, and political domains. Open data and
  artificial intelligence (AI) are vital for future value creation. The value of
  aligning open data with AI development and deployment requirements has been
  elaborated upon in the Garden State Open Data Index (GSODI) 2023 report. The
  GSODI research report also provides policy recommendations which can guide the
  development of open data ecosystems to maximize support for AI systems and
  applications. The searchable GSODI portal is expected to ‘serve as a
  complementary and collaborative mechanism to existing open data
  infrastructure’ and does not intend to host datasets or in any way replace the
  many open data portals. Instead, it is expected to augment these open data
  portals and increase the findability of open data. Furthermore, the GSODI
  framework possesses a simple and flexible indexing framework and can therefore
  be scaled into a universal open data index to integrate global open data.
  Future research is expected to focus on scoring and ranking mechanisms along
  with improved scalability leading to enhanced capabilities for supporting AI
  research, development, and deployment.
