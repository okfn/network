description: "Registry of data portals, catalogs, data repositories, and e.t.c.\r\n\r\nThis is a transitional repository to create a registry of all existing open data portals and repositories.\r\n\r\nThis is the first pillar of the open search engine project. Other pillars include:\r\n\r\n -  registry of all catalogs (this one)\r\n -  datasets raw metadata database\r\n -  unified dataset search index and search engine\r\n -  datasets backup and file cache\r\n\r\nThis project was inspired by Re3Data and Fairsharing projects. The key difference is the focus on open data as a broad topic, not just open research data.\r\n\r\nThe final version of this repository will be reorganized as a database with publicly available open API and bulk data dumps.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of data catalogs were collected?\r\n\r\nThis registry includes a description of the following data catalogs:\r\n\r\n    Open data portals\r\n    Geoportals\r\n    Scientific data repositories\r\n    Indicators catalogs\r\n    Microdata catalogs\r\n    Machine learning catalogs\r\n    Data search engines\r\n    API Catalogs\r\n    Data marketplaces\r\n    Other"
