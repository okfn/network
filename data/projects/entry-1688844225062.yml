description: "Bangladesh is one of the countries that are most affected by climate change. Reports of climate induced disaster is being reported by the media whenever it is happening. But report on changes in climate components is absent because of the lack of accessible data.\r\n\r\nThe Open Climate data-kit has been built to provide journalists’ and researchers’ climate data in readily accessible format. On this platform you can access and download time series data and graphs on : (a) temperature, (b) rainfall, (c) river water flow, (d) cropland, (e) forest, and (f) climate induced disaster. For most components the data covers a time range from 1986-2021. Dataful has curated the data from PDF files published by The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics – the national statistical agency."
