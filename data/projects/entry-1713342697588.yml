description: "WeVis, a pioneering civic technology initiative in Thailand, is dedicated to empowering citizens through open data and digital participatory tools. Over the past 5 years, our organization has evolved from a group of dedicated young volunteers into a dynamic force for democratic engagement.\r\n\r\nOne of our most significant endeavors has been the development of a parliament monitoring toolâ€”an innovation previously nonexistent in our country. Inspired by platforms like TheyWorkForYou and GovTrack with the hope of seeing political transparency in our society, we embarked on this journey in 2019, developing these platforms to suit Thailand's political landscape. With not much knowledge background, we created TheyWorkForUS (theyworkforus.wevis.info) as an MP tracker, Law Watch (wevis.info/law-watch) as a bill tracker, and Promise Tracker (promisetracker.wevis.info) as a policy tracker.\r\n\r\nThroughout this process, we encountered challenges stemming from inadequate parliamentary data and the complexity of the legislative process. However, we persevered, conducting extensive research and developing strategies to address these obstacles. We engaged in policy advocacy to promote freedom of information, devised automated tools to convert paper-based data into machine-readable formats, and crafted scripts to compile legislative documents.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we prioritized stakeholder feedback, soliciting input from voters, political parties, MPs, parliamentary officials, media outlets, and academics. This feedback informed the continuous improvement of our projects. Also, we have connected with parliamentary monitoring organizations in other countries to learn more about how should we monitor the parliament.\r\n\r\nWe are now proud to announce the launch of Parliament Watch, an open-source comprehensive platform (parliamentwatch.wevis.info) that serves as a one-stop solution for monitoring Thailand's parliament. Throughout these 5 years of endeavoring, encountering setbacks, refining, and learning, we are eager to share our journey in this presentation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we aim to inspire others working in civic tech. We demonstrate how data analysis and digital tools enhance transparency in the legislative process, hold MPs and political parties accountable, and empower voters during elections. Our efforts have also facilitated increased civil society participation in parliamentary committees and working groups, amplifying public voices."
