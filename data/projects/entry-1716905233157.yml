name: Whaling History - Connecting All Things Whaling
description: "This data-driven site is useful to a wide range of people, from family historians searching for ancestors, to scholars of the whaling industry, to teachers and their students. At the heart of the site are seven interconnected databases. Three of them relate to American offshore whaling: one describing every known voyage from the 1700s through the 1920s, another transcribing location information from whaling logbooks, and the third containing crew lists for these voyages. Two of the databases relate to the British Southern Whale Fishery (1775–1859): one describing every known voyage, whaling or sealing, to the south of Britain, and one containing the corresponding crew lists. The sixth database describes whaling voyages from British North America, including Nova Scotia and New Brunswick from 1779–1845. And the seventh describes voyages from France.\r\n\r\nThe Whaling History website is a collaboration between Mystic Seaport Museum, New Bedford Whaling Museum and Nantucket Historical Association. Our core databases are primarily the work of Judith Lund and Tim Smith (AOWV & AOWL), Dale Chatwin (BSWF), Wesley Sanger (SAW), J. Thierry duPasquier (LBF) and Andrea Kirkpatrick (BNA)."
