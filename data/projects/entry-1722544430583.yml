description: "# Meristemos Project\r\n\r\nAccording to Wikipedia, meristems or meristematic tissues are: \"responsible for plant growth. Their cells are small, polyhedral in shape, thin-walled, and have small and abundant vacuoles. They are characterised by being poorly differentiated. They are capable of division, and it is from these cells that the other tissues arise. The main characteristics of meristematic cells are their polyhedral and equidimensional appearance,\".\r\n\r\nLike humus, which fertilises the soil, meristems are the growth cells of plants.\r\n\r\nWith this analogy, Meristemos is the research and learning strategy in data science, activism and data visualisation of the ReDHumus Community. This is an open collaborative group.\r\n\r\nThis is a commitment of ReDHumus to apply and develop capacities in the creation of contents that combine humanistic social research with the construction of knowledge artefacts that make use of the technologies and methodologies of software creation especially for the use, restructuring, modification-hacking and deconstruction, not only of data, but also of individual and collective subjects. With this we seek to complete the circle of production-consumption from a countercultural perspective, which has a vocation for open social transformation, popular science and other perspectives related to the approaches of collective intelligences that in general inspire the ReDHumus Cooperative. \r\n\r\nThat is why, by adopting the name of artefact, we conceive this bet not only as a testing exercise like the ones we have previously developed in order to make our strategy public, but as a bet to build with our own forces (but thanks to community learning) an infrastructure that allows us to give answers to the needs of building our own voice (a locus).\r\n\r\nIn this new time, we connect more deeply with the purpose of making the exercise of information more sovereign and autonomous in a bid to regain control over the data and the creations we derive from them.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the present experience takes a step further in the slow process with the appropriation of the proposals of various communities with which we feel a closeness in thought and action.\r\n\r\nIn this way, we take the distributed versioning systems that emerge from software development projects as a tool for the management of repositories of learning devices where we converge with the code-text-putting out our voice thinking.\r\n\r\nWe hope to continue to share here the timeline and documentation of our learning process.\r\n\r\nWe put into critical practice (appropriation) the experiences and knowledge shared in different communities of practice such as:\r\n\r\n    - Graphoscope\r\n    - Programming Historian\r\n    - Panama Declaration on Open Science\r\n   - Green paper on Citizen Science for Europe: Towards a society of empowered citizens and enhanced research\r\n\r\n## Ongoing projects are:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bajo Sinú\r\n\r\nData visualisation for the Social Movement \"Water telling stories\", an organisational process in the lower Sinú river basin in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. They were carried out in the framework of a collaborative research project of the Postgraduate in Rural Development of the Autonomous Metropolitan University of Mexico City.\r\n\r\nSee theses\r\n\r\nThese visualisations are being published in a data portal for the use of the inhabitants, producers and grassroots social organisations of the Bajo Sinú region at https://agua.redhumus.org.\r\n\r\nThe process of translating these data visualisations into the PY4WEB environment is underway and the repository will also be backed up in redundant copies. The invitation is open to those who can collaborate in this process. Contributors can do so in this repository in GitLab, in FOSSIL or directly on the web platform. More information and contact details at https://redhumus.org\r\n\r\n\r\n### Libertarian Tools\r\n\r\nFormerly called \"Humanitarian Tools\", this project seeks to develop, adapt and implement methodologies and tools to link ICTs, free software and literary programming to activism processes, defence of human rights, land and territory. The following projects have emerged organically:\r\n\r\n[] Use of LLM for support in audio-to-text transcription: Use of the Whisper model and other models.\r\n[] Applications for sentiment analysis and use of open source data\r\n[] Support tools for qualitative data analysis\r\n[] Calculating the Multidimensional Poverty Index\r\n[] Calculation of the GINI Index, GINI for Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tools for the appropriation of self-protection strategies in face-to-face and digital environments."
