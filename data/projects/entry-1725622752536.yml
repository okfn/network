name: Early intervention of VITAL DOCUMETS
description: >-
  Being a person who is adopted and finds herself alone with no vitals. Stolen
  deliberately and changing daily for 6 years.  It's a battle but believe I can
  make something positive out of this situation and maybe one-day help others
  know that it's okay what others think it WHAT YOU KNOW AND STAND YOUR GROUND. 
  Some days it's hard but do your best you can do to let others know the truth. 
  My truth your truth the universe will show your way.  My journey on finding
  myself was hard.  I cried I smiled I hide in shame but I still am blessed in
  knowing FACTS NOT THE LIES.  NO ONE CAN RUN FAST ENOUGH TO ESCAPE IT.  AND I
  WILL CONTINUE AND TRY BETTER TOMORROW I HAVE A LONG JOURNEY STILL AHEAD.  MY
  VITAL RECORDS ARE VERY WRONG I KNOW THE FACT AND I AM me not a labeled person
  from placement of the big institutions.  I'm loved maybe I was supposed to
  just have that one love I lost.  I MISS MY DADDY.
