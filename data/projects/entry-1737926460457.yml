name: Unlimited Cities
description: "Unlimited Cities is an innovative civic tech platform that stands out as a powerful tool for collective intelligence in urban planning. This free and open-source solution has been recognized by UN-Habitat as a best practice for implementing the New Urban Agenda since 2016. What sets Unlimited Cities apart is its unique approach to citizen engagement, taking urban planning directly to the streets and public spaces.\r\n\r\nUnlimited Cities has been deployed at around 50 sites in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. \r\n\r\nBy bringing the planning process out of traditional meeting rooms and into the heart of communities, Unlimited Cities ensures that a diverse range of voices are heard, from busy professionals to marginalized groups who might not typically participate in urban development discussions. This street-level approach allows the platform to capture a more comprehensive and inclusive vision for urban spaces, reflecting the true needs and aspirations of all city dwellers.\r\n\r\nThe platform's user-friendly interface and mobile accessibility enable citizens to visualize and propose changes to their urban environment in real-time, fostering a sense of ownership and empowerment. By involving local communities in the design process, Unlimited Cities not only helps create more liveable and sustainable cities but also strengthens social cohesion and civic participation. This innovative approach to urban planning exemplifies how technology can be harnessed to build more inclusive, resilient, and people-centered cities, aligning perfectly with the SDGs goals."
