name: Flooding and lanslides impacts to local comunity's social life
description: "Around 2020, the climate crises observed in the town of Uvira surprised the local communities living in the town of Uvira, eastern part of the DRC, who woke up in full floods due to the rising waters of the Mulongwe rivers and Lake Tanganyika. These floods, accompanied by vast landslides, ravaged several households, fields, livestock and human life. \r\nSeveral people and families found themselves homeless and even in the fields.\r\nThe project consists of carrying out hackathons, exchange workshops with these communities with the aim of identifying their urgent needs and seeing how to remedy these situations."
