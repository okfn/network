  subsequently, his M.Sc. in Complex Systems and Networks, at the Aristotle
  University of Thessaloniki. He works as a Developer and Data Scientist in
  research projects with Open Knowledge Greece. Recently, he worked on the
  Erasmus+ project, ENTICE (https://entice.eu/), where he semantically described
  medical terms with the UMLS Metathesaurus, linked them with VR terms, and
  developed the ENTICE CORE ONTOLOGY to conceptually describe the six
  experiential episodes of the project. He also, participated in the development
  of the Red Flags application which uses data analysis techniques to identify
  possible red flags in the Greek NHRF projects and presents them in an
  easy-to-understand manner. Currently, heâ€™s working on the Horizon European
  funded project UPCAST (https://www.upcast-project.eu/) for the Thessaloniki
  Pilot, which involves sharing public administration data for climate change.
