reason: "My experience intertwines, technology program management, foreign and security policy, developmental cooperation in the realm of AI policy and advocacy for social impact sectors. In addition, having worked with practitioners and domain experts that are working with marginalized communities at inclusion of AI for end-mile usage. This helped me to determine the challenges faced by vulnerable communities and what it entails at creating a working AI infrastructure that enables and caters to the needs of the marginalised communities. \r\nI also see that few understand the basic threshold requirements of AI fundamentals that are needed in the social impact sectors such as healthcare, agriculture and education required to drive the benefits at the grassroots. In addition, the fascination for the use of AI as an enabling technology has by far caught the attention of the decision makers. \r\nI want to be part of the directory as I being in real experience to the forefront and present real-life challenges at the implementation of AI based technologies that has meaningful impact at the grassroot."
