reason: "15 years ago, I was co-founder of the Austrian chapter of OKFN. Unfortunately, OKFN Austria did not succeed to becoming a sustainable organization. \r\nBut I stayed on the topics of open knowledge. I initiated www.offenerhaushalt.at - which is an Open Spending portal for Austrian municipalities where more than 1,500 are publishing their datasets.\r\nAlso, I work as open data expert in Austria and Germany.\r\nCurrently I am focusing on knowledge management in organizations at KM-A.\r\nSince there is no other Austrian partner currently in you network and I still share your vision and mission, I would like to be added to the directory:\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nBernhard"
