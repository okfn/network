The event was held on 26 and 27 July 2022 at the University of Mahajanga under the name “Hay Tech”. The objectives of the event were to familiarise young researchers from multiple backgrounds with using GIS as a crucial conservation tool for decision, strategy, and planning; to train young researchers in critical thinking about conservation strategy and climate change action based on GIS outcomes; and to create a space for networking among researchers.\r\n\r\n30 participants joined the workshop and 3 mentors from the University of Mahajanga facilitated the workshop. The initial session started by setting up QGIS, and for that Herizo RADONIRINA helped participants. Kanto RAZANAJATOVO opened the workshop by welcoming participants, conducting a self-introduction, and an ice-breaking session. Then, Dr. Bernard ANDRIAMAHATANTSOA made an introductory session about the importance of GIS in the environmental context and biodiversity conservation. The impact of climate change on biodiversity loss and the necessity of monitoring biodiversity were also pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe workshop content was beginner friendly so that everyone could follow it easily. Case studies and datasets of the Boeny region were given to participants as an application and the whole session has been conducted using both French and Malagasy languages. The following modules were done during the session:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the QGIS interface\r\nCreating a map and importing data, scaling\r\nHandling vector and raster file\r\nBasics spatial analysis\r\nMentors lead the participants to think about solutions to tackle climate change effects and biodiversity loss in Madagascar based on the outcomes from the GIS workshop session. In this session, participants are trained to adopt critical thinking on issues that Madagascar biodiversity is facing. Numerous ideas were collected from each participant; to support researchers from the local/national government to undertake an in-depth study about biodiversity and climate change; to adopt an adequate policy and good governance to stop biodiversity losses; to build synergies for the multidisciplinary collaborations and commitments.\r\n\r\nBolivia Tech Hub (Bolivia)\r\nBolivia Tech Hub organised Open Data Day Bolivia on Saturday, 18 June 2022; where participants paired as a team to work together for data exploration and collaborative work. During a 7 hours long event, the participants selected 5 topics to organise the exploration. The topics were:\r\n\r\nEnvironmental needs water and soil\r\nEnvironmental monitoring\r\nEnvironmental biodiversity\r\nWaste and protected area\r\n34 participants (14 female and 20 male) from La Paz and El Alto city joined the event. During the event, we learned that access to environmental data from Bolivia is not readily available as we thought. Nevertheless, there’s a vibrant community with the need and desire to work to make them accessible. Also that the networking part of the event was the participant’s favorite.\r\n\r\nDream Factory Foundation (Botswana)\r\nOn 25 June 2022, Dream Factory Foundation hosted the first ever in-person workshop focusing on the importance of using Open Data sources to support smallholder farmers’ agricultural activities. Guest lecturer of the workshop was Bashanganyi Magwape who not only made the workshop informative but also practical by running an exercise where attendees created an open data source using the Whatsapp Business API to input information they wanted on each other in real-time.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the event was the presence of Honourable Tselawa, the Councillor who was there on behalf of the Mayor of the City of Francistown. He remarked how this event was the first of its kind in the city and that he would use the learnings to parliament to advocate for diverting currently closed river channels to be reopened for the benefit of local farmers. He said, “I have walked away from here with a new mandate to take to parliament”.\r\n\r\nThe event was attended by 31  guests, including government officials as well as farmers across the country. The tagline for the day became: “Open Data is about we and not me”. We used a WhatsApp Chatbot data collection tool to show how we can practically contribute to open data, how easily farmers can contribute, and how we can benefit from the answers as well.\r\n\r\nLekeh Development Foundation (Nigeria)\r\nWith a goal to train the Ogoni community on practical air quality monitoring for effective environmental management, Lekeh Development Foundation organised the Open Data Day to train critical stakeholders on the use and deployment of air quality monitoring sensors, and the need of advocacy to entrench a clean and healthy environment for the Ogoni people. Ogoni has become a symbol of environmental degradation, which has impacted air, water and soil. This has led to various problems ranging from environmental, socio-cultural, and then, to health issues. The event was hosted on 28 June 2022.\r\n\r\n40 participants were carefully selected among climate defenders, environmental/human rights activists, members of coastal communities, and key stakeholders to be trained on air note devices and practical air quality monitoring for effective environmental management and advocacy. Presentations were on;\r\n\r\nAir quality reading for advocacy, engagement, and campaign at the local, state, and federal levels.\r\nPractical demonstration on how to take readings and use the air quality monitor.\r\nImpact of air quality monitoring on health and wellness.\r\nThe event strengthened the capacity of the community to protect themselves and the environment in general by increasing their knowledge of environmental data collection. During the event, it was stressed many times that there is a deep relation between the well-being of a community and the well-being of the environment.\r\n\r\nDuring her presentation, Nnenna Obike Oviebor noted that the air quality note is an apt tool that should be deployed in all areas of air pollution monitoring to actually get the real data and extent of air pollution. The data could serve as evidence for advocacy to bring about the needed action for the well-being of the community people. Participants appreciated the organiser and funder of the project for enlightening them on air quality management. Participants said there is a need for coastal Ogoni communities to monitor the air quality and have devices installed at strategic points, a soil spills and gas flaring are sadly becoming normal incidents.\r\n\r\nLeBari Baridakara from the local government called on the air note devices to be donated to a climate change unit in the local authority for in situ air quality monitoring for record-keeping at the local level. We hope to further engage 10 volunteers who would be monitoring the instrument for bi-weekly and monthly analysis of the data. The data will be compared with allowed limits, and the outcomes will be shared with the local authorities within Ogoni. This will hopefully help drive the needed action.\r\n\r\nFundación Datalat (Ecuador)\r\nFundación Datalat organised Mapathon to create maps with environmental open data. The Mapathon was a hybrid event that took place on 29 July 2022 that promoted the use of environmental open data that are being published by the Ministry of Environment related to forests, national parks, and conservation lands in Ecuador. A kit was provided to all participants, which included all material needed to visualise maps offline using the data provided during the event.\r\n\r\nThe Mapathon was aimed at people between 18-35 years old, including students, activists, journalists, civil society, and other data and environment enthusiasts. It took place locally in Latacunga – Ecuador and it also had a virtual space through Zoom. The activities included a workshop to explain open data, environmental open data, off-line mapping tools, and mapping indications, followed by hands-on activities to produce maps with the provided materials.\r\n\r\nThe event was facilitated by the Datalat team which included experts on geography, data analysis, visualisation, and communications and design. It also included personnel from the Ministry of Environment that guided the attendees about the use of the environmental data. The Mapathon lasted 4 hours and was carried out in 3 parts;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants used 5 open geographic datasets focused on the province of Cotopaxi. These databases were: a) National Protected Area System, b) Restoration priority area, c)Area Under Conservation from the Socio-Bosque Programme, d) Land Cover 2018, e) Deforestation period 2016-2018. In total, between online and on-site participants, the Mapathon produced 30 analog maps about environmental and conservation issues that allowed us to understand the perspective each participant had about these issues and environmental conflicts. \r\n\r\n——–\r\n\r\nOpen Data Day is an annual celebration of open data all over the world, where we gather to reach out to new people and build new solutions to issues in our communities using open data.\r\n\r\nFor the 2022 edition of Open Data Day, Open Knowledge Foundation supported 14 events with small grants. Please find the details of all grant winners here.\r\n\r\nPosted in: Open Data Day, Open Data Day 2022\r\n\r\nAbout Nikesh Balami\r\nNikesh is an open data advocate and tech researcher based in Nepal.

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy Checkup\r\n\r\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\r\n\r\nTake the Privacy Checkup\r\n\r\nEffective September 16, 2024\r\nArchived versions\r\nDownload PDF\r\nContents\r\nIntroduction\r\nInformation Google collects\r\nWhy Google collects data\r\nYour privacy controls\r\nSharing your information\r\nKeeping your information secure\r\nExporting & deleting your information\r\nRetaining your information\r\nCompliance & cooperation with regulators\r\nAbout this policy\r\nRelated privacy practices\r\n\r\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\r\n\r\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\r\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\r\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\r\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\r\n\r\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation Google collects\r\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\r\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\r\n\r\nThings you create or provide to us\r\n\r\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\r\n\r\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\r\n\r\nInformation we collect as you use our services\r\nYour apps, browsers & devices\r\n\r\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\r\n\r\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\r\n\r\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.\r\n\r\nYour activity\r\n\r\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\r\n\r\nTerms you search for\r\nVideos you watch\r\nViews and interactions with content and ads\r\nVoice and audio information\r\nPurchase activity\r\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\r\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\r\nChrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account\r\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\r\n\r\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to Google Account\r\n\r\nYour location information\r\n\r\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\r\n\r\nDepending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\r\n\r\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\r\nIP address\r\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\r\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\r\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\r\n\r\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\r\n\r\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Google collects data\r\nWe use data to build better services\r\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\r\n\r\nProvide our services\r\n\r\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\r\n\r\nMaintain & improve our services\r\n\r\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\r\n\r\nDevelop new services\r\n\r\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\r\n\r\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\r\n\r\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\r\n\r\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\r\n\r\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\r\nWe don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\r\nWe don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\r\n\r\nGo to My Ad Center\r\n\r\nMeasure performance\r\n\r\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\r\n\r\nCommunicate with you\r\n\r\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\r\n\r\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\r\n\r\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\r\n\r\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\r\n\r\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.\r\n\r\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\r\n\r\nWe’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour privacy controls\r\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\r\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nGo to Privacy Checkup\r\n\r\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\r\nWhen you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.\r\n\r\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\r\n\r\nPrivacy controls\r\n\r\nActivity Controls\r\nDecide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\r\n\r\nGo to Activity Controls\r\n\r\n\r\nAd settings\r\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\r\n\r\nGo to My Ad Center\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout you\r\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\r\n\r\nGo to About You\r\n\r\n\r\nShared endorsements\r\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\r\n\r\nGo to Shared Endorsements\r\n\r\n\r\nSites and apps that use Google services\r\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\r\n\r\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\r\n\r\nWays to review & update your information\r\n\r\nMy Activity\r\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\r\n\r\nGo to My Activity\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Dashboard\r\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\r\n\r\nGo to Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\nYour personal information\r\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\r\n\r\nGo to Personal Info\r\n\r\nWhen you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\r\n\r\nSigned-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\r\nYouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\r\nAd Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\r\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\r\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\r\n\r\n\r\nExport your data\r\n\r\nTo delete your information, you can:\r\n\r\nDelete your content from specific Google services\r\nSearch for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\r\nDelete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\r\nDelete your entire Google Account\r\n\r\nDelete your information\r\n\r\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:\r\n\r\nBrowser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\r\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\r\n\r\nSharing your information\r\nWhen you share your information\r\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\r\n\r\nWhen Google shares your information\r\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\r\n\r\nWith your consent\r\nWe’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.\r\n\r\nWith domain administrators\r\nIf you’re a student o"
