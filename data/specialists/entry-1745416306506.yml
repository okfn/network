  I would want to join the Open Knowledge Foundation Network (OKFN) because my
  research interests strongly align with the principles of open knowledge
  championed by the foundation. OKFN's mission to create a fair, sustainable,
  and open digital future by advancing open knowledge as a design principle
  resonates with my extensive work on electronic theses and dissertations
  programs, which inherently deal with the accessibility and impact of academic
  research. My research on access and impact barriers to academic publications
  and my role as a Visibility and Open Science Consultant further underscore
  this alignment. OKFN's vision of openness and open knowledge being adopted by
  every government, institution, and movement to ensure access to critical
  information also connects with my experience as a Bibliometrics Consultant,
  where I likely work to improve the visibility and impact of research
  institutions. My membership in UNESCO's Information for All Programme (IFAP)
  Committee in Iran also indicates a commitment to broader access to
  information.
